            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>What is the current state of travel? Covid has changed a million things about the world we live in, and I became curious about how it’s changed travel. How has the travel industry changed? How are the habitual travelers of the world doing, and how have their needs changed during Covid? I decided to investigate this question through the design process. I found that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The fundamental needs of travelers as the same as ever - the search for connection, adventure, and authentic experiences, but that the way they seek those experiences has changed, and technology can help solve that problem. </p>

            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>My team member, Monet Hopkins and I conducted 6 user interviews with experienced international travelers. We asked about their good travel experiences, their bad travel experiences, how they plan their trips, and what their apprehensions are with Covid. We found a trove of fascinating information, including that users are worried about Covid safety, but that they’re still looking for unique, authentic experiences that they can’t get at home. </p>

            <p class="lead">After several iterations, we landed on this problem statement: “We believe that providing specific and relevant local knowledge and recommendations to travelers that want to be more than just tourists will help them to connect deeply to new cultures, meet new people, and feel empowered to travel to new destinations.”
            With this in mind, we decided that an app that connects travelers to locals - the ultimate repositories of relevent local knowledge - would be the way to move forward. We created features that our users found important, and created the framework for our users to chat with and call local contacts, with the ability to filter based on their specific interests. </p>

              <h1>The Future</h1>
              <p> learned so much during this first project. I loved working with Monet during the ideation phase, and I found her input invaluable. I learned that I need to make the design process work for me, and to make it my own. 
                I also learned that while the app idea was interesting, in the future, I think that I need to focus more on the problem, instead of getting wrapped into the idea I have in my head for an app too early. 
                If I was going to do something next with Localize, I would build it out a lot more. I would add a feature that allows a traveler to save links and recommendations their local contact sends them to a dashboard that allows them to plan their trip easier
